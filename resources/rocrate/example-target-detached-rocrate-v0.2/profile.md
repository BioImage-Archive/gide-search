# GIDE search input ro-crate profile

## ro-crate-metadata structure overview

As input, we expect a _detached RO-Crate_ consisiting solely of an ro-crate-metadata.json. This file _MUST_:

1. Generally abide by the requirements of a detatched ro-crate. At a high level this includes:
    - 1.1 Contain a self-describing RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor, with an @id of ro-crate-metadata.json, and a conformsTo of https://w3id.org/ro/crate/X where X equal to or greater than 1.2 (the version which defined detached ro-crates)
    - 1.2 Have a root dataset entity which the ro-crate-madatada.json describes (via the 'about' property).
2. The root dataset entity has an @id that is an absolute url to a page where the more information can be found about the entry and the data can be obtained.
3. Use the context term definitions in gide-search-context.jsonld. Additional terms _MAY_ be added, however, terms that are defined in this context _MUST NOT_ be changed to point at new IRIs.

### Expected objects

The @graph of the ro-crate-metadata _MUST_ include:

- Exactly one self-describing RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor.
- Exactly one root dataset entity of type _Dataset_, linked from the self-describing RO-Crate Metadata Descriptor via the _about_ property.
- One or more Taxon objects, of type _Taxon_, at least linked to the root dataset entity via the _about_ property.
- One or more Imaging Method objects, of type _DefinedTerm_, at least linked to the root dataset entity via the _measurementMethod_ property.
- One or more Authors, of type _Person_, linked to the root dataset entity via the _author_ property.
- Exactly one Publisher object, of type _Organisation_, linked to the root dataset entity via the _publisher_ property.

We _RECOMMEND_ including additional objects:
- Objects of type _Organisation_ to describe Author _affiliation_
- Further descriptions of the biological content that was captured in the images, with objects of type _BioSample_, and _DefinedTerm_.
- Further descriptions of the methods used to capture the images, with objects of type _LabProtocol_ and _DefinedTerm_.
- Descriptions of the methods used to analyse or annotation images
- Publications, of type _Publication_, which the dataset supported, or which provide additional detail on the methods used to create the dataset.


### Overview of graph between objects

Where a property can connect to a list of objects of different types, these have been grouped into a box. As an example, we require all relevant biological subjects of imaging to be referenced by the 'about' property of the dataset, but this does not preclude additional links between these objects (such as a BioSample's taxonomicRange also connecting to a Taxon listed in the 'about' of the dataset).

### QuantitativeValue

We recommend providing two QuantitativeValues for a dataset to give an estimate of the quantity of data associated that can be retrieved from the publisher
- The number of files/images etc, stored by the publisher of the dataset. This MUST use the unitCode http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000189 (count) and the unitText "file count".
- The quantity of bytes of the total dataset, as recorded by the publisher (whether compressed or otherwise). This MUST use the unitCode http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UO_0000233 (bytes) and the unitText "bytes".

Additional QuantitativeValue may be included.

| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| @id | | REQUIRED | 1 | SHOULD be a local identifier for the QuantitativeValue. |
| @type | rdf:type | REQUIRED | 1+ | MUST include QuantitativeValue, but may include other types. |
| value | schema:value | REQUIRED | 1 | SHOULD be number, using '.' to indicate a decimal point (rather than ','), and SHOULD avoid using either symbol as readability separators. |
